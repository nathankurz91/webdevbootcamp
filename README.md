-   .attr() retrieve and set the attribute of elements
-   .val() gets a value in inputs and other form elements
-   \$(this) for jQuery this keyword

### Static vs Dynamic

-   Dynamic webpages constructs the html depending on certain variables/states
-   NodeJs, express, mongodb
-   Request/Response cycle
-   Get - get data
